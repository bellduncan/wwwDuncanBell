## Introduction
This is the code for my website 'wwwduncanbell', deployed to Azure as a 'DuncanBell' web app at:
https://duncanbell.azurewebsites.net/

The site is built from Express.Js, and uses the Microsoft WebChat component too.
By default the site loads the 'index.ejs' page in the 'views' directory.


## Local Server
To start the server locally, use the following command in integrated terminal for 'wwwDuncanBell':
   npm run start
OR
   node ./bin/www

Then navigate in a browser to:
   http://localhost:3000

To stop the server, press Ctrl C in the integrated terminal.


## Deployment
Select the 'Azure' icon, then right click on Azure Subscription -> App Services -> duncanbell -> Deploy to web app


## Issues
None :-)
